## Introduction
**decisorGUI** uses AHP (_Analytic Hierarchy Process_) to evaluate and help decision making process, interactively.<br>
To use the software, you must have the following:
- An **Objective**
- A list of **criteria**
- A list of **alternatives**
- A list of valid **weights** for pairwise comparisons among criteria and alternatives

The software will help you map weights to criteria and alternatives, yielding a result vector that shows which alternative to pick according to a model.
