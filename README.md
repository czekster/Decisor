# decisorGUI
Binaries for the decisor software (using Analytic Hierarchy Process - AHP)
--
## Introduction
This is a short manual for the software, main funcionalities and how to use it, in general.

The software is suited for decision problems with multiple criteria and alternatives. Literature on the subject suggests to have no more than 7 criteria or 7 alternatives at once, however, the software will handle a much larger number. The problem will be the number of needed pairwise comparisons that must be input into the model.

## More information on AHP
Understand the underpinnings of AHP is rather simple, there is a [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process) page with several discussion and information.

## Decision problems
Decision problems usually arises on several domain applications, such as:
- Supplier Selection Problem (SSP): how to choose best suppliers given several competing criteria?
- Management: should I buy a machine or hire another professional? who should I fire based on performance?
- Location: where should I build my next branch?

## Manual
The decisorGUI is a very intuitive and simple tool to model decision problems using AHP.
